# Network Analysis of Astrophysics Collaboration

This project utilizes the igraph package in R to conduct network analysis on collaboration data within the field of Astrophysics. It explores various network metrics such as centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector), shortest paths, and adjacency matrix analysis to uncover insights into collaboration patterns and identify influential nodes within the network.

## Usage

1. **Requirements:**
   - programming language: `R`
   - Required packages: `igraph`

2. **Instructions:**
   - Clone the repository or download the `network analysis astrophysics.R` script.
   - Ensure your R environment has the igraph package installed (`install.packages("igraph")`).
   - Run the script `network analysis astrophysics.R` to perform network analysis and generate results.

3. **Output:**
   - Analysis results include centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector), shortest paths, adjacency matrix, and visualizations.
   - Insights into collaboration patterns and identification of key nodes in the Astrophysics collaboration network.

## Files

- `network analysis astrophysics.R`: R script containing the code for network analysis using the igraph package.
- `CA-AstroPh.txt`: Sample dataset containing edge data for collaboration relationships in Astrophysics.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Centrality Measures:** Analysis of degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality to assess node importance.
- **Shortest Paths:** Calculation of shortest paths between nodes to understand connectivity.
- **Adjacency Matrix:** Visualization and analysis of the network structure using the adjacency matrix.
- **Visualization:** Plotting of the network graph to visualize collaboration relationships.
