# Network-Analysis-of-Astrophysics-Collaboration
This project performs network analysis on collaboration data from the Astrophysics community using the igraph package in R. It explores various network metrics such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and shortest paths to understand the structure and key nodes within the collaboration network.
